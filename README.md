## Overview

This project illustrates how to connect a backend (likely RESTful or GraphQL) with a React-based UI. The backend handles data fetching and manipulation, while the front-end consumes this via hooks and manages global state with Context API.

---

## Architecture

The application is organized into two main parts:

- **Server (Backend)**  
  - Handles API requests, business logic, and data responses.  
  - Built possibly using Node.js with Express or similar.  
  - Manages routing, controllers, models (if any), and middleware.

- **Client (Front-End)**  
  - Built using React.  
  - Fetches data from the server using React Hooks (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`, custom hooks).  
  - Manages global or theme-related state using Context API (`React.createContext()` and `useContext`).

Data flows from the backend server→JSON over HTTP→handled inside React components (via hooks)→shared across components using Context API.
